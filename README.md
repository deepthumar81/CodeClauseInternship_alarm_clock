# Alarm-Clock
Tkinter GUI project for timekeeping

A simple alarm clock GUI project that I worked on to improve coding habits,improve my knowledge of tkinter and pygame modules, and utilize a database. When complete, this will be a fully functioning program similar to the "Clock" app on Android or its iOS equivalent. It has support for a local digital clock and alarms at the moment. Further improvements to the alarms is my next task. I seek to add customizable messages, sounds, and repeat settings.

## Alarms
You can set alarms to go off at whatever time you set. You can also deactivate the alarm so it will not go off.

## Clock
This digital clock shows the current local time in HH:MM:SS format.
